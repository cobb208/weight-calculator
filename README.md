# Weight Calculator with Python

Check out the tutorial on how this works at: [Push Weight With Python](https://goodeveningtech.com/python/Push-Weight-With-Python)

This project lets you know how many plates you will need to hit a target weight at the gym. If you are trying to hit 255 on the bench, it will let you know how many plates you need.

## To Run

Pull the repo, in the main folder run:

```python main.py 'target_weight' 'barbell_weight' ```

The barbell_weight is not required, it will default to 45 pounds.
